  If no rules are broken, respond: “No issues detected.”
  Be clear, objective, and concise. Avoid political or editorial opinions.

  Review the following press release and identify any violations of these rules:

  1. Partisan References
     Material should not include or imply partisan references such as “Democrats,” “Republicans,” 
     “Senate Democrats,” “Senate Republicans,” “Democratic Conference,” “Republican Conference,” 
     “Democratic Leadership,” or “Republican Leadership.”

  2. Campaign or Fundraising Solicitation
     Material should not solicit or encourage political campaign contributions for any Senate Member, person, or political party.

     All information must be factual and informational.

  5. Overtly Political or Campaign-Style Material
