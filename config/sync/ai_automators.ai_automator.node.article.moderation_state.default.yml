Harsh or Derogatory Language Toward Public Official\r\n   (Allow criticism of agencies, policies, and general actions; only restrict personal attacks)**\r\n\r\n   Material must not contain insults, harsh criticism, or strong derogatory statements directed at:\r\n\r\n   -an individual legislator or public official (named or by title), or\r\n\r\n   -a legislative caucus, including the Senate Majority Conference, Senate Minority Conference, Assembly Majority Conference, or Assembly Minority Conference.\r\n\r\n   Violations include language that:\r\n\r\n   -Personally attacks a public official (“Governor X is corrupt,” “Senator Y is incompetent”).\r\n\r\n   -Uses strong derogatory or inflammatory wording toward a legislative caucus (“The Senate Majority Conference is reckless,” “The Minority Conference is dangerous and irresponsible”).\r\n\r\n   -Attributes malicious intent, incompetence, or wrongdoing to a caucus or public official.\r\n\r\n   -Frames a caucus as harmful, negligent, corrupt, or otherwise disparaging.\r\n\r\n   Allowed — do NOT flag under Rule 3:\r\n\r\n   Criticism of organizations, agencies, authorities, or systems, including:\r\n\r\n   -“The MTA’s proposal is dangerous.”\r\n\r\n   -“This agency has failed to provide transparency.”\r\n\r\n   -“The program’s implementation has been deeply flawed.”\r\n\r\n   Criticism of legislation, policy decisions, budgets, or governmental actions, including strong disagreement or concern:\r\n\r\n   -“This policy is dangerous and short-sighted.”\r\n\r\n   -“The budget proposal fails to address community needs.”\r\n\r\n   -“This decision could harm small businesses.”\r\n\r\n   -“The budget falls short for working families.”\r\n\r\n   Mild subjective or negative descriptors (e.g., “dangerous,” “concerning,” “misguided”) as long as they are not directed at a specific public official.\r\n\r\n   These should NOT trigger a violation unless used in a personal attack.\r\n\r\n   Criticism directed at a group action without naming individuals, such as:\r\n\r\n   -“Lawmakers should have acted sooner.”\r\n\r\n   -“Leadership must address this issue immediately.”\r\n    These refer to collective bodies, not individual officials.\r\n\r\n   Clarification:\r\n\r\n   Rule 3 is not intended to block policy disagreement, strong criticism of government actions, or negative descriptions of agency decisions.\r\n\r\n   It only applies when criticism becomes personal and targets a specific individual public official.\r\n\r\n   In addition, it applies to Senate Majority Conference, Senate Minority Conference, or any other political caucus must be treated as prohibited, even if no individuals are named.\r\n\r\n   A press release should be flagged under Rule 3 only when the language is unmistakably a personal attack, not merely strong disagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Fictitious or Non-Informational Content\r\n   Material should not contain opinions, speculation, or fabricated statements presented as fact.\r\n   All information must be factual and informational.\r\n\r\n5. Overtly Political or Campaign-Style Material\r\n   Material should not appear promotional, partisan, or more suitable for campaign literature than an official government communication.\r\n\r\n    Violations include content that:\r\n\r\n    -Urges readers to vote for or against a candidate, party, or ballot measure.\r\n\r\n    -Praises or promotes an elected official or candidate in a campaign-style way (e.g., slogans, exaggerated praise, \"re-elect,\" \"champion of,\" \"we need your support to keep them in office\").\r\n\r\n    -Attacks, smears, or campaigns against a candidate, party, or group rather than explaining policy.\r\n\r\n    -Uses explicit campaign messaging, slogans, or calls to action aimed at influencing an election (e.g., \"Join our movement to defeat X,\" \"Help us keep Democrats/Republicans in power.\")\r\n\r\n    Allowed – do NOT flag under Rule 5:\r\n\r\n    Neutral or factual descriptions of:\r\n\r\n    -Legislation or proposals that affect campaigns, campaign finance, or elections, including bills to restrict campaign contributions, increase transparency, or reform election law.\r\n\r\n    -The roles of elected officials or agencies in overseeing campaign finance or elections.\r\n\r\n    References to non-political campaigns, including:\r\n\r\n    -Nonprofit capital campaigns\r\n\r\n    -“Individual donor campaigns” for nonprofits\r\n\r\n    -Community organization fundraising campaigns\r\n\r\n    -Public service campaigns or awareness campaigns\r\n\r\n    -Positive or appreciative quotes about community partnerships or nonprofit achievements.\r\n\r\n    -Descriptions of government funding or collaborative efforts that help organizations raise or secure nonpolitical funds.\r\n\r\n    Critical instruction:\r\n     Do NOT infer a Rule 5 violation solely because the text contains the word “campaign.”\r\n     A violation occurs only when content resembles electoral or political campaign messaging—not when describing a nonprofit’s capital campaign or community fundraising initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION LOGIC:\r\n\r\n- If ANY of the rules above are violated, you MUST set \"state\" to \"flagged\".\r\n- If NONE of the rules are violated, you MUST set \"state\" to \"published\".\r\n- You MUST NOT use any other value for \"state\". Only \"flagged\" or \"published\" are allowed.\r\n\r\nREASONING REQUIREMENTS:\r\n\r\nIf you choose \"published\":\r\n- Do not add any output to reasoning.\r\nIf you choose \"flagged\":\r\n- \"reasoning\" must be 1 to 4 sentences of clear, concise explanation for editors and must include all violations.

If multiple rules are violated, you MUST mention every one of them in the reasoning.\r\n\r\nOUTPUT FORMAT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\r\n\r\nYou MUST respond ONLY with RFC8259-compliant JSON in EXACTLY one of the following shapes:\r\n\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"value\": {\r\n      \"state\": \"flagged\",\r\n      \"reasoning\": \"...\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"value\": {\r\n      \"state\": \"published\",\r\n      \"reasoning\": \"...\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n- The outer value is a JSON array containing exactly ONE object.\r\n- That object has a single key \"value\".\r\n- \"value\" is an object with exactly two keys: \"state\" and \"reasoning\".\r\n- \"state\" is either \"flagged\" or \"published\" (lowercase).\r\n- \"reasoning\" is a string of 1 to 4 sentences.\r\n\r\nDo NOT include any other keys or fields.\r\nDo NOT include any text before or after the JSON.\r\nDo NOT include comments, markdown, headings, or explanations outside of the JSON itself.\r\n\r\nText:\r\n--------------------\r\n[node:title]\r\n[node:field_subtitle]\r\n[node:body]\r\n[node:field_layout_components:0:entity:field_body_left]\r\n[node:field_layout_components:0:entity:field_body_right]\r\n[node:field_layout_components:0:entity:field_accordion_item:0:entity:field_body:value]\r\n[node:field_layout_components:1:entity:field_accordion_item:0:entity:field_body:value]\r\n--------------------\r\n"
