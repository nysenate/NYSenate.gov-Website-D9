description: "<em>Articles</em> should be written in the Senator's voice, while a <em>Press Release</em> is a tool of communication between members and reporters. When Articles are tagged with an issue, they will appear on the dashboards of constituents that follow that issue. Press Releases, in contrast, do not appear on constituent dashboards, they appear prominently in the Senator's front page newsroom section and their newsroom page."
