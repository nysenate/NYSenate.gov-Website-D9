    '#title': 'Broome Developmental Center ' 
    '#description': "Over the past few months as your NYS Senator, it has been brought to my attention that many individuals in Broome County are concerned about the potential use of the old Broome Developmental Center. \n\n\nUnfortunately the closure of Broome County Developmental Center (BCDC) has led to a hard transition period for many of my constituents. The decision to close this facility was established before my time in office and is still a topic of conversation all over the district. I would like to move forward with a potential solution rather than seeing another building deteriorate in our community.\n"
