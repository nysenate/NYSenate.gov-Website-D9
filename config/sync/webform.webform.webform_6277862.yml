    '#title': '1. Free SUNY College Tuition: The Governor recently proposed making SUNY/CUNY schools tuition-free for students with a household income under $125,000. Supporters argue that students are being overburdened with the rising costs of higher education while opponents point to alternative means to improve college affordability and argue that such a program will be far too costly for the state and its taxpayers. Do you think SUNY/CUNY schools should be tuition free?'

Supporters of expanding ride-sharing throughout the state argue that it will greatly improve access to transportation, especially for students and seniors. Opponents argue that drivers employed by these companies should be subject to the same restrictions as those currently driving taxis. Do you support allowing these companies to operate throughout New York?'

Property Tax Cap: New York State has a property tax cap that limits the growth in property taxes to 2% or less which helps hold the line on local taxes and allows homeowners to budget better. Opponents argue that the tax cap puts too much pressure on local governments. Do you support making the tax cap permanent?'
