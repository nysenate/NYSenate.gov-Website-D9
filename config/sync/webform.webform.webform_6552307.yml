      1: ' YES'
      2: ' NO'
      3: ' NO OPINION'
    '#title': '1.	New York State has a property tax cap that limits the growth in property taxes to 2% or less, which helps hold the line on local taxes and allows homeowners to budget better. To date, it has saved local taxpayers an estimated $621 million in school taxes and another $226 million in county property taxes. Opponents argue that the tax cap puts too much pressure on local governments and school districts and will result in a loss of services. Do you support making the tax cap permanent? '

      3: ' NO OPINION'
    '#title': '2.	At the end of last year, the federal government passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, enacting dramatic reforms to the federal tax system. Because our state’s tax laws are often intertwined with those at the federal level, a series of proposals have been presented to help the state adjust to the reform. One of these proposals includes replacing the state’s income tax with an optional statewide payroll tax. Do you support the implementation of an optional statewide payroll tax? '

    '#title': '3.	The Executive Budget Proposal would impose a surcharge on prescription opioids with the funding generated being designated to an “Opioid, Prevention, Treatment and Recovery Fund.” Opponents argue that the increased cost will inevitably be passed on to consumers.

    '#title': '4.	New York State has spent over $11 million in the past decade to settle sexual harassment cases in state government. I sponsor legislation (S.7337) that would require the state to create an independent commission charged with investigating these types of claims in order to empower victims, increase transparency, and prevent the use of taxpayer dollars to fund secret settlements.

    '#title': '5.	In his State of the State Address, the Governor included important proposals aimed at curbing the spread of Lyme and tick-borne diseases, however he did not include any funding in his Executive Budget Proposal. Do you support making funding for critical research, the development of a more accurate test for Lyme disease, education, and prevention initiatives a high priority in this year’s State Budget, even if it means other health care initiatives will receive less funding?'

    '#title': '7.	Legislation has been introduced to create a single-payer health program in New York that would replace private insurance plans with a system that is run by the state. By some estimates, the new system would triple or quadruple the size of the State Budget, but others estimate that the proposal could save the state significantly.

The ‘Sandwich Generation’ is a term used to describe individuals—often between their 40s and 50s—who are responsible for helping to meet the needs of both their children, and their aging parents. Being a member of the Sandwich Generation can come with unique pressures, and as the state seeks to enable seniors to age in place, at home, in their community, we are working to understand how we can better empower those in this generation.
