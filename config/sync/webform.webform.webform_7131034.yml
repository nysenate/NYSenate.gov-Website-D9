    '#title': '1. Single Payer Healthcare (S. 3577) - Legislation has been introduced to create a single payer healthcare program in New York that would replace private insurance plans with a system that is run by the state. By some estimates, the new system would triple or quadruple the size of the State Budget, but others estimate that the proposal could save the state significantly. Would you support the creation of a state-run, single payer health system in New York?'

Driver’s Licenses for Illegal Immigrants (S. 1747) - The Green Light Bill is a proposal currently being considered that would expand access to standard driver’s licenses to all state residents regardless of immigration status. Proponents of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants argue that it will increase road safety by allowing the state to test their ability to drive and also allowing these drivers to access automobile insurance. Opponents argue that the measure rewards lawbreakers and say it will leave the system vulnerable to fraud and abuse. Do you support allowing undocumented or illegal immigrants to obtain standard New York State driver’s licenses?'

    '#title': '3.	Legalizing Recreational Marijuana - Legalization of recreational marijuana has been touted as having the potential to boost the economy and provide tax dollars for state projects. Opponents argue that legalizing recreational marijuana incentivizes people to use and could lead to an increase in traffic accidents resulting from individuals driving under the influence. Additionally, some argue that while the state should not legalize the use of recreational marijuana, New York should ‘decriminalize’ low-level marijuana possession.  Do you support the legalization of recreational marijuana?'

    '#title': '4.	Physician-Assisted Suicide (S. 3947) - Senate Bill S. 3947 would allow mentally competent, terminally ill patients in New York to request medication from their doctors that would allow them to end their own lives. Supporters of physician-assisted suicide argue that an individual should have autonomy to decide when to end their own life, provided certain strict criteria are met that would ensure they are of sound mind when their decision is made. Opponents argue that individuals already have the power refuse treatment if they so choose and argue that the measure would leave New Yorkers—especially elderly or ill New Yorkers—vulnerable to coercion and abuse. Do you support legalizing physician-assisted suicide? '

    '#title': '5.	Taxpayer Funded Campaigns - This year’s state budget included a mandate that would require a commission to create a small donor public campaign-financing program for statewide and state legislative offices by the end of 2019. The budget authorized up to $100 million to be used to fund the program each year. Those in favor of taxpayer-funded campaigns argue that a small donor matching funds system would boost small donations to candidates by matching them with state funds and thereby reduce the influence of special interests in politics. Opponents argue that taxpayers should not be forced to pay for political campaigns, advertising and campaign consultants, especially at the expense of other critically important programs. Would you support a proposal that allowed the state to spend $100 million per year to subsidize political campaigns? '

Proponents argue that New York is missing out on substantial tax revenue from sports betting that is currently taking place outside the state or illegally within the state. Opponents argue that legalized sports betting could compromise the integrity of sports contests and increase problem gambling. Do you support legalizing sports betting in New York?'

    '#title': '7.	Farmworkers Bill (S. 2837) - The “Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act” would require farmers to pay farmworkers overtime, provide a day of rest as well as disability insurance, unemployment benefits, and grant them collective bargaining rights, which would allow them to the right to strike. Advocates argue that laborers in other industries have long held these rights and believe farmworkers should enjoy these benefits as well. Opponents cite the unique nature of the agriculture industry as the reason for the exception, and argue that farmers already provide their workers with unique benefits more in line with the nature of the business, like free housing. Critics argue the bill would fundamentally alter the way the agriculture industry works and that the increased costs associated with the changes have the potential to devastate New York Farms. Do you support the “Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act”?'

    '#title': '8.	Eliminating Religious Exemption from Vaccines (S. 2994A) - Currently, students attending school in New York State are required to receive certain vaccinations, however exemptions are granted for medical reasons or for “genuine and sincere religious beliefs.” A bill has been introduced (S.2994A) that would repeal this religious exemption, effectively mandating vaccines for all children except those with legitimate medical reasons who cannot be vaccinated. Supporters of this legislation argue that some New Yorkers are exploiting the religious exemption to refuse vaccines for their children even if they do not sincerely hold these religious beliefs. Additionally, proponents cite the potential for unvaccinated students to contract and spread otherwise preventable diseases, jeopardizing the health of other community members. Opponents argue that religious freedom protections preserve a parent’s right to opt out of vaccinating their children and that such a choice should not prevent their child from receiving an education. Do you support eliminating the religious exemption from school vaccine requirements, and only allowing an exemption for medical reasons?'
