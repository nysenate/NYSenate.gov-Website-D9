    '#title': 'Bail Reform -  In 2019, NYS enacted a series of bail changes that limited the factors a judge can consider when setting bail. Supporters of these changes have argued that judicial discretion results in higher rates of incarceration and should not be allowed to influence decisions regarding bail, while opponents of the change have argued that the defendant’s criminal history and the threat they pose to public safety should be among the many factors considered when determining whether to set bail. I have sponsored a bill (S. 6947) since 2019 that would give judges the ability to consider public safety concerns when setting bail. Do you support this initiative?'
