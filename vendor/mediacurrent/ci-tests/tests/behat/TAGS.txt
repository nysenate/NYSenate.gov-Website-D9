Existing tags
*************

Entire features or individual scenarios can be tagged as follows to assist in running tests:

Tags to assist in selectively running tests
===========================================

@smoke
@smoke-test
    A broad selection of key tests that can be run quickly to make sure you haven't broken anything.

@ci
    Used to include a feature or scenario in the continuous integration system.

@api
   To invoke the Drupal/Drush driver, tag the scenario with @api
	"Its biggest limitation is that the tests must run on the same server as the Drupal site".

@dependent
    Used to indicate a scenario that is dependent on data created previously in the same feature file. In a perfect world, scenarios like this would not exist, and the tag will help us isolate the scenarios if/when we come up with a better solution. Scenarios should *never* depend on data from a different feature file.

@javascript
    Used when the feature being tested relies on CSS or javascript and must use a fully-featured browser for accurate testing. Note: Selenium or a headless browser must be running on the system executing tests or these scenarios will fail.

@slow
    Used for scenarios that are, well, slow. There is not, as yet, a definitive metric like, requires more than 10 seconds to complete.

@wip
    Used to tag a work-in-progress. These are typically excluded from a test run as they may fail or do not yet fully test the feature described.

@anon
    Used for scenarios/features that don't require user authentication to run the test.

@specific_text
    Denotes tests that are looking at text that is more likely to change and require update.

@timeout
    Tests that are likely to timeout, currently at 30 seconds.

@bug
    Known bug.  Donâ€™t execute under normal runs.  Similar to Skip.

Section Tags:
=============

The tags below are used to identify where a feature (not an individual scenario) is located within the site map. These should be the first tag on the left above the feature description.

@front

Featureset Tags
===============
Featureset tags describe features that don't correspond to a traditional site map structure or are complex features at a lower level on the site.

@admin
@user

Tags to hook into the test process
==================================

Certain tags are used to hook into the testing process to trigger activity. For example, a scenario that creates a node might be tagged with @cleanData will attempt to delete content created by one of its steps. See http://docs.behat.org/guides/3.hooks.html for a detailed discussion of how this works in behat.
