#Charts Blocks

Use this module if you would like a chart added via Layout Builder or the
"Block layout" page. You will need to enable at least one charting provider
submodule before this module can be used. Data can be added manually or by
uploading a CSV file.

If you create your chart using a View, you do not need this module - just add
a "Block" display to your View.
