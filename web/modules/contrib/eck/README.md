## Entity Construction Kit

The Entity Construction Kit (ECK) builds upon the entity system to create a
flexible and extensible data modeling system both with a UI for site builders,
and with useful abstractions (classes, plugins, etc) to help developers use
entities with ease.

# INTRODUCTION

adding bundles to entity types; and fields to bundles,
with the help of the Field UI module.
