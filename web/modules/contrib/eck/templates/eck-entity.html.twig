/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to display an ECK entity.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - eck_entity: The full ECK entity with limited access to object properties
 *   and methods. Only "getter" methods (method names starting with "get",
 *   "has", or "is") and a few common methods such as "id" and "label" are
 *   available. Calling other methods (such as node.delete) will result in an
 *   exception.
 * - content: All ECK entity items. Use {{ content }} to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}. Use
 *   {{ content|without('field_example') }} to temporarily suppress the printing
 *   of a given child element.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_eck_entity()

 * @ingroup themeable
