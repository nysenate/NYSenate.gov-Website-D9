## Requirements

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.


## Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. For further
information, see

- [Installing Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-drupal-modules).
- Manage the flood table at People > Flood Unblock
  (/admin/people/flood-unblock)


## Configuration

1. Navigate to _Configuration > People > Flood Control_
   (/admin/config/people/flood-control)
2. Change the desired settings


## Manage flood table

Drupal prevents brute force attacks on accounts. It does so by refusing login
attempts when more than 5 attempts failed. The amount of failed logins is
recorded in the table 'flood'.

Flood Unblock provides an interface that makes it possible for site
administrators to remove IP addresses and user ID's from the flood table.

You need _access flood unblock_ permissions to access the _Flood Unblock_ page.


### Steps

- In the _Manage_ administrative menu, navigate to _People_ (/admin/people)
- Click the tab _Flood Unblock_ . The Flood Unblock page appears
- Select (all) the IP addresses and User ID's that you want to unblock
- Click _Remove_. The IP addresses and User ID's have been unblocked and it
  should be possible again to try to login
