# Redirect 403 to User Login

Redirect the HTTP 403 error page to the Drupal /user/login page with a message
that reads, "Access denied. You must login to view this page." Also, a redirect
to the desired page is appended in the url query string so that, once login is
successful, the user is taken directly where they were originally trying to go.

Makes for a much more user-friendly Drupal.
