Introduction
------------

Views Bulk Edit allows modifying field values of a selected list of entities
of any type. It works with Drupal core actions as well as the Views Bulk Operations (VBO) module, offering all of its
benefits like batching, ability to select all view results or persistent
selection across pages.


Requirements
------------

Views Bulk Edit works with Drupal core but can also be used with the Views Bulk operations module.


Installation
------------

Install as any other Drupal 8 module.


Configuration
-------------

1. Create or edit any view, the most convenient display type for end
   user in case of VBO views is Table.
2. Add a "Views bulk operations" field (global), available on
   all entity types, if not already added.
3. Check the "Modify field values" action.
4. (Optional) Define a "bulk_edit" form mode for the entity bundles
   that you wish to be able to bulk edit. Under the "Form modes" page
   at /admin/structure/display-modes/form you can add a new form
   mode. If it uses the machine name "bulk_edit", the form for the
   "Modify field values" action will use that form mode to determine
   what fields are available for bulk editing.
