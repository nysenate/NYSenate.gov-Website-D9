## Requirements

The batched export functionality of this module requires a MySQL database.
This module also requires version 2.7 or higher of views.

This module requires the following modules:

- [CSV Serialization](https://www.drupal.org/project/csv_serialization)


## Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. For further
information, see
[Installing Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-drupal-modules).


## Configuration

1. Navigate to Administration > Extend and enable the module.
2. Navigate to Administration > Structure > Views and create a View Page
   that will display the information that you want to filter and export
   (You will go to the path of this page to generate the export once done).
   The View can be whatever display/format type that you need as it will be
   the interface that the user will filter by and then export data from.
3. Add the fields that you want to display and include in the export, then
   add the exposed filters that you want to filter by in order to create
   custom exports (user role, status, pretty much any field you need).
4. Add a new display and select Data export.
5. From the Format field set, select the Data export settings. Select from:
   csv, json, or xml formats. Request formats that will be allowed in
   responses. If none are selected all formats will be allowed. Apply.
6. From the Pager field set, set to 'display all items' for the data export.
   Otherwise the results will be limited to the number per page in the pager
   settings.
7. From the Path Settings field set, change the "Attach to" settings to
   "Page".
   to attach the data export icon to the selected displays.
8. Ensure that the 'path' for the data export is a file, with an extension
   matching the format. ie: /export/foo.csv. Otherwise, the file will be
   downloaded without a file association.
9. Navigate to the path of the View Page to generate the report.
