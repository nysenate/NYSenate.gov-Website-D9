<p><strong>Expenditure Report</strong></p>
<p>The Report includes fields for the referenced office,
expense type, payee (employee or vendor), payee beginning and
end date with the Senate (in the event of a Vendor, the
check date is the end date), title/description of service,
 paytype (see below), amount paid (for employees displays
  the amount paid over six (6) month period), note and
 Expenditure Report beginning and end date.</p>
<p><strong>Expense Type Note:</strong> The expense type
"Allocated Operational Expenses" shows the cost of any postage,
Albany-based long distance telephone calls, and supplies
by each office. It is important to note that these costs are
 allocated back to each office after-the-fact based on
 what was used by that office. (Post Office for postage,
 Telecommunications for long distance telephone charges,
  and Senate Supply for supplies). The costs shown under
 "Allocated Operational Expenses" are for informational
  purposes only.</p>
<p><em>Payroll Types:</em></p>
<p><strong>Regular Annual (RA)</strong> - All
employees who are appointed to work at least 1820 hours during a calendar
year (including holidays and approved leave time)
and who are anticipated to be on the payroll year round will be
 assigned to this payroll. (This is equivalent to a
 work week of 35 hours.) In addition, anyone commencing work after
  the first weekday in January will be assigned to this payroll
  if they have been appointed to work a minimum number
   of hours which, if prorated and projected for an entire year,
    would equal 1820 hours and they are anticipated to
   work 1820 hours in the next full calendar year.</p>
<p><strong>Special Annual (SA)</strong> - Employees may be assigned
to this payroll if they: are appointed to work
 less than 1820 hours for a full calendar year; OR are appointed for
  less than a full calendar year.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary (TE: Hourly Rate)</strong> - Employees who
work a very irregular schedule and who are paid an
hourly wage will be assigned to this payroll.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor</strong> - For the organizational simplicity of
the Expenditure Report spreadsheet, Vendor payments
 have been placed in the "PayType" column. These payments are to
  contracted third parties. Their rates are negotiated
 on a per contract basis.</p>

<p><strong>Member Travel Detail For Expense Checks</strong><p>
<p>Under the NYS Constitution (Article III, Sec.6), Senate Members
 are eligible to receive payment of actual and
necessary expenses for travel to and from Albany.  Senate Members
are eligible to receive a full or partial per
diem equivalent to the most recent federal per diem rates published
 by the US General Services Administration
in accordance with subdivision 2 of section 5 of the Legislative Law.
 A per diem is an allowance for lodging,
meals and incidental expenses.  Policies are set forth by the
Temporary President of the Senate, to provide for
reimbursement when the Legislature is not in session.</p>
<p>This report provides a six month accounting that details travel
 and per diem expenses incurred by Senate
Members, processed and paid through the travel and expense component
 of the Statewide Financial System (SFS).</p>
<p>The Member Travel Detail Report will be issued by the Secretary of
the Senate on a biannual basis as part
of the Senate Expenditure Report and is available as both a .csv file
and its original PDF format for download
at the bottom of the page.</p>
