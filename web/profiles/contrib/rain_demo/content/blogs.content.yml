    - value: As customers walk into retail stores today some of the first things they notice are interactive kiosks and screens offering convenience and fast new ways to find and pay for items. These electronic displays serve a very useful, customer-specific purpose, but there’s much more to this story than what meets the eye.

        <p>Recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau still shows that less than ten percent of all retail transactions happen online. Retailers with traditional brick-and-mortar stores that are committed to connecting the dots between underlying IT infrastructure and customer-facing digital technology have the best opportunity to continue thriving in the digital age. But creating that underlying infrastructure is complicated, often involving dozens of vendors with distinct technologies like networking, security devices, point-of-sale, printers, employee systems, inventory management, and more. And all of this tech must work as one integrated unit to deliver a new and improved store experience. With most of this technology positioned behind the scenes, customers might never fully realize its impact on the trip they just made to buy diapers for their children, refill a prescription, or just grab a late-night snack. Nonetheless, an IT environment that is supported in a comprehensive way can have a positive impact on the future of an entire business. It can lead to more effective and concentrated IT support, more accurate data insights that IT professionals and business executives can use to outperform the competition, and a more loyal customer base.</p>

        <p>By 2020, members of Generation C – connected, communicating, content-centric, computerized and always clicking – will comprise 40% of the population of the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Russia, India and China. They will be the largest single category of consumers in the world. This is what makes the digitization of your business so important. And what makes your current network – assuming you use VPN – so debilitating. VPN technology was created more than 20 years ago. To put that into perspective, it was introduced the same year as the 56k dial-up modem. VPN wasn't designed to handle the 21st century business challenges of big data, cloud computing, mobile workforces and the Internet of Things. A VPN can't deliver the secure, reliable and high-performance connectivity your employees need to collaborate and your customers need to transact business with you. But don't take our word for it. Ask around.</p>
