          <p>The Legislature is the law-making branch of state government. It is a bicameral, or two-house, body composed of the Senate and the Assembly. The Constitution authorizes a Senate of varying number, currently 63 members, and an Assembly of 150 members, who are elected from districts throughout the State for two-year terms. Each member of the Legislature must be a United States citizen, a resident of the State for five years and, in most cases, of the Senate or Assembly district for one year preceding the election.</p><p>After each election, the Senate elects from among its members a Temporary President who serves a two-year term. Traditionally, the Temporary President is the ranking Senator of the majority political party — the Majority Leader. It is the duty of the Temporary President to direct and guide the business of the Senate, appoint Senate committees, name Senate employees and perform or delegate to another Senator the duties of the President during the Lieutenant Governor’s absence from the Senate Chamber.</p><p>The Constitution reserves varied and extensive powers for the Legislature. The most important is that which permits the Senate and Assembly to propose laws, within the limits of the Federal Constitution and certain Federal statutes and treaties. These laws first take the form of bills, which may be introduced in either house. A bill passed by one house must be passed in the same form by the other before it can be sent to the Governor for a signature or veto.</p><p>The Senate and Assembly have several additional powers that are reserved solely for them in the Constitution. An important weapon in legislative deliberation is the override of the Governor’s veto. The Legislature can approve a law despite a veto by the Governor with the support of two-thirds of the membership in each house. However, the most common lawmaking procedure is the result of compromise among the Senate, the Assembly and the Governor.</p><p>The Senate alone has the power to confirm the Governor’s appointment of non-elected state officials and court judges. The Constitution provides that such appointments are subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, which approves or disapproves them, after hearings on the candidate’s qualifications.</p><p>The Legislature, through its varied functions, serves as a check upon the executive authority of the Governor and helps ensure that the best interests of the State’s citizens are legislatively represented.</p>

          <p>The job of the Senate is to work with the Assembly and the Governor to enact, amend or repeal statutes which make up the body of laws by which we are governed. This involves drafting, discussing and approving bills and resolutions.</p><p>The text shows the process in a simplified progression from Idea to Law. At any step in the process, participation by a citizen or group of citizens is as easy as making a call, writing a letter, or signing a petition being sent to your Senator, any other legislator or the Governor.</p>

  <p>Under the Rules of the Senate, all Senators vote to elect one its members as Temporary President (or ‘President pro tempore’) of the New York State Senate and Majority Leader. The position of Temporary President was created as a standing office by a constitutional amendment in 1873. The President pro tempore was elected for the duration of the biennial senatorial term which comprised two sessions, the first in an even-numbered year, the other in the following odd-numbered year. It is the duty of the Temporary President to direct and guide the business of the Senate, appoint Senate committees, name Senate employees and perform or delegate to another Senator the duties of the President during the Lieutenant Governor’s absence from the Senate Chamber.</p>
  <p>Each Conference in the Senate also elects its own Conference Leader and other conference leadership positions.</p>
  <p>The Temporary President and Conference leaders are all currently limited to a term of eight years under the Rules of the Senate.</p>

        <p>In 1885, the 1850's version of the New York State Coat of Arms was selected by the Legislature as the "permanent design and legal form." The seal symbolizes the following:</p>
  
      <ul>
              <li>In the center, a shield reveals the sun rising behind Mount Beacon over the Hudson River. “The shield symbolizes in the full sun the name and idea of Old York and the old world; the mountains, river and meadow, with the ships, convey the name and idea of New York in the new world.”</li>
              <li>To the right, Justice is ready to fight tyranny with her sword held high.</li>
              <li>Liberty on the left, holds her foot on the overthrown English Crown. “This New York is supported by Justice and Liberty, and discards monarchy.”</li>
              <li>The world globe is displayed above the shield. “By exhibiting the eastern and western continents on the globe, the old and new are brought together;”</li>
              <li>Above the world globe soars the eagle. “while the eagle on the crest proclaims,” Westward the course of empire takes its way.”</li>
              <li>The bottom ribbon exclaims “Excelsior,” which means “still higher” or “ever upward.”</li>

      <p>The Senate uses open-source software whenever possible. In our experience, open-source software is reliable, secure, and cost-effective. It also provides us with the flexibility necessary to create software that meets the Senate’s needs.</p>
      <p>We also support the greater open-source ecosystem. We have sponsored new functionality in open-source projects, and have contributed our own code to projects. We also open-source our own code whenever possible so that others can benefit from our work.
