  "title": "About the New York State Senate",
  "welcome_text": "<p>The New York State Senate is the upper house of the New York State Legislature. Its sixty-three members represent New York State and its more than 19 million citizens. The legislatureâ€™s primary purpose is to draft and approve changes to the laws of New York.</p><p>These changes are driven by complex public policy issues. To effectively represent the will of the people, senators must gain a deep understanding of those issues and how they impact New Yorkers.</p><p>This website aids in that effort. NYSenate.gov is designed to increase public participation in the legislative process. By facilitating efficient communication between individual New Yorkers and the senators who represent them, lawmakers are able to craft a better set of laws by which we are governed.</p>",
