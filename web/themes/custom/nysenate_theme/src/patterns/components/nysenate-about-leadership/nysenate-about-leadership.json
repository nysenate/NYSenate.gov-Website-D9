The position of Temporary President was created as a standing office by a constitutional amendment in 1873. The President pro tempore was elected for the duration of the biennial senatorial term which comprised two sessions, the first in an even-numbered year, the other in the following odd-numbered year. It is the duty of the Temporary President to direct and guide the business of the Senate, appoint Senate committees, name Senate employees and perform or delegate to another Senator the duties of the President during the Lieutenant Governor’s absence from the Senate Chamber.</p>\n  <p>Each Conference in the Senate also elects its own Conference Leader and other conference leadership positions.</p>\n  <p>The Temporary President and Conference leaders are all currently limited to a term of eight years under the Rules of the Senate.</p>",
