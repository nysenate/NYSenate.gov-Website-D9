# Breakpoints are used for responsive image configuration within Drupal 8.
# https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming-drupal-8/working-with-breakpoints-in-drupal-8
#
# NOTE: While normally used for defining breakpoints for use with the <picture>
# element, it's a better idea to use <img> with srcset and sizes instead.

# Below is an example of how to create srcset placeholders in Drupal.
# The sizes attribute still needs to be configured manually within
# `admin/config/media/responsive-image-style`.
